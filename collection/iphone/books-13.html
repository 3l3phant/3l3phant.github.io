                                        American Sign Language (ASL) is something we've all seen deaf people use in restaurants, hospitals, airports, and at work. The communication is fascinating to watch; to see people sharing ideas by using handshapes and body language is remarkable in a world so defined by sound. This new edition of "Signing For Dummies" gives you a general understanding of the properties of Sign, as well as an understanding of deaf culture. Designed to act as an introduction or a refresher, the book focuses solely on ASL, which is the most commonly used sign language in the United States.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Categorized by subject, this illustrated guide covers grammar and sentence structure, along with the tools to get you going in basic conversation by knowing how to introduce and greet people; ask questions and make small talk; order food and chat with salespeople; handle medical emergencies; talk on the phone; get around town for fun or business; and much more. Plus, it stresses how ASL isn't just about using your fingers, hands, and arms, but also about facial expression and body language. More than 25 percent new and revised content, including the latest technological advances for the deaf; contact signing, code mixing, code switching, interpreting as a profession, and regionalism in signing Packed with "Fun &amp; Games" sections that invite you to practice specific signs Hundreds of illustrations throughout, plus a video CD featuring demonstrations by ASL signers showing actual conversations<br />
                                        <br />
                                        "Signing For Dummies" is the fast and fun way to get you moving your hands, body, and face to convey meaning that reaches beyond linguistic barriers.</p>

                                        Out of the maelstrom of chaos the demons came–a primordial horde of perverse souls consumed by hatred. They are as ancient and infinite as the multiverse itself. Even the bottomless Abyss could not contain their malice, and so they spread out across the planes, corrupting and destroying everything in their path. No living soul is beyond their reach, and with each conquered soul their numbers grow. What can stand against such a terrifying onslaught?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        This supplement for the D&amp;D® game presents the definitive treatise on demons and their unspeakable home plane. Along with information about the physiology, psychology, society, and schemes of demonkind, you’ll find feats, spells, items, and tactics commonly employed by demons and those who oppose them. This book also provides detailed information on various demons, demon lords, and Abyssal layers.<br />

You and your fellow adventurers have defeated the slavers at Highport, but you have learned of the existence of another slaver stronghold, and you have decided to continue the attack. But beware! Only the most fearless of adventurers could challenge slavers on their own ground, and live to tell of it!

This module contains a challenging scenario, the tournament scoring system plus nine pre-rolled, playtested tournament characters. Also included are large scale referee's maps, notes, and background information. A2 is a complete adventure in itself, but it is also a companion to A1 (Slave Pits of the Undercity), A3 (Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords) and A4 (In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords). Be sure to look for other exciting adventure modules from the Game Wizards at TSR." Contibutors; Harold Johnson and Tom Moldvay.</p>

                                    <p>A Classic in Counterintelligence―Now Back in Print<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Originally published in 1987, Thwarting Enemies at Home and Abroad is a unique primer that teaches the principles, strategy, and tradecraft of counterintelligence (CI). CI is often misunderstood and narrowly equated with security and catching spies, which are only part of the picture. As William R. Johnson explains, CI is the art of actively protecting secrets but also aggressively thwarting, penetrating, and deceiving hostile intelligence organizations to neutralize or even manipulate their operations.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Johnson, a career CIA intelligence officer, lucidly presents the nuts and bolts of the business of counterintelligence and the characteristics that make a good CI officer. Although written during the late Cold War, this book continues to be useful for intelligence professionals, scholars, and students because the basic principles of CI are largely timeless. General readers will enjoy the lively narrative and detailed descriptions of tradecraft that reveal the real world of intelligence and espionage. A new foreword by former CIA officer and noted author William Hood provides a contemporary perspective on this valuable book and its author.</p>

                                    <p>Kult is a contemporary horror role-playing game which explores the dark side of the human soul. Reality is not what we think. Around us the world is dark and dangerous and nothing is what it seems to be. Our reality is an illusion, created to keep us captive. We are imprisoned since ages past by a dictatorial creator. The true world, invisible to us, is ruled by creatures who dominate behind the false facades, our prison wardens and torturers. The characters in 'Kult' are dark heroes, governed by Destiny. When the illusions shatter, they face the true reality.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Kult is a complete role-playing game and includes 1) The Lie - rules for creating player characters with abilities, dark secrets, advantages and disadvantages and skills. 16 ready-made archetypes (each infull color) will enable you to create an interesting character speedily and commence playing. 2) The Madness: Rules for encountering terror; advanced, realistic combat rules; and a comprehensive, logical magic system 3) The Truth: A consistent background to help you to recreate different horror atmospheres. Our illusion and dark realilty are described in detail, together with the creatures and cults who lurk behind the veil.</p>

                                    <p>This campaign book is an exciting new approach to CYBERPUNK 2020 adventures by Atlas Games. The format encompasses a tough, no-holds-barred scenario that will challenge any player group's roleplaying and tactical skills; plus a wealth of valuable new game material that may be applied to any Cyberpunk campaign.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The PCs are hired to be mercenary commanders in a full-blown Third World conflict. At stake are the interests of entrenched oligarchs, military strongmen, revolutionary zealots, and big corporations. The cyberpunks get the opportunity to shape war and history in the 21st century.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The Chrome Berets features:<br />
                                        <br />
                                        - Complete background on the Malagay Islands, a young pacific republic writhing under the twin hells of oppression and revolution. Isn't a tropical vacation just the thing for cyberpunks who've had too much of the big city? - Dozens of non-player characters — dubious allies, formidable foes, self-interested politicians, and unscrupulous middlemen — who will interact with the player characters. - An outline of plots, events, and NPC interests that gives the Referee all the information she needs, while judiciously avoiding a prescription of linear adventure. The characters' very goals, to say nothing of the story's resolution, are completely flexible. - KILL OR BE KILLED: a mass-combat system for the Cyberpunk game. It's suitable for large-scale operations that the Friday Night Firefight system in the rulebook can't very well cover. - New military hardware that your cyberpunks may put into action on the island — maybe even bring home afterward. This source material could be used for any Cyberpunk campaign, anywhere in the world.</p>
